Python Super App
================================================================================
This Python script combines five powerful features into a single "super app" for
fetching data from Wikipedia, Google Search, and generating visualizations. The
application is designed with a user-friendly menu interface and robust error 
handling to make it easy to explore a wealth of information dynamically.

Key Features:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Wikipedia Summary Fetcher:
   - Fetch concise summaries for any topic from Wikipedia.
   - The user specifies the topic and the number of sentences (default: 2).
   - Handles errors like ambiguous topics or non-existent pages.

2. Google Search Result Scraper:
   - Retrieve the top N search results for any query using the 
     `googlesearch-python` library.
   - The user specifies the search query and the number of results (default: 5).
   - Provides clean links for further exploration.

3. Wikipedia Categories Explorer:
   - Extract the categories associated with a given Wikipedia page.
   - Useful for understanding the classification and related subjects of a topic.
   - Handles missing or invalid topics gracefully.

4. Related Topics Finder:
   - Identify up to N related topics (links) for any Wikipedia page.
   - Great for exploring connected concepts or diving deeper into a subject.
   - Handles edge cases like missing pages or restricted links.

5. Wikipedia Page Word Cloud:
   - Generate a word cloud visualization from the text content of a Wikipedia page.
   - Offers a visual way to understand the prominent terms and themes in a topic.
   - Displays the word cloud in an interactive Matplotlib window.

Application Architecture:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Modular Design:
  Each feature is implemented as a separate function to ensure reusability,
  scalability, and maintainability.

- Interactive Menu:
  A command-line menu interface allows users to select and customize the 
  functionality they wish to use. Input prompts guide the user throughout.

- Error Handling:
  The app gracefully handles errors, such as ambiguous Wikipedia topics, invalid
  search queries, missing pages, or external library issues.

- Dynamic Inputs:
  Users can adjust parameters like the number of sentences in a summary, the 
  number of Google search results, or the depth of related topics dynamically.

How to Use the App:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Run the script.
2. Choose a feature from the menu by entering the corresponding number:
   - Option 1: Get a summary of a topic from Wikipedia.
   - Option 2: Perform a Google search and retrieve the top N links.
   - Option 3: Fetch the categories of a Wikipedia page.
   - Option 4: Explore related topics for a Wikipedia page.
   - Option 5: Generate a word cloud from a Wikipedia page.
   - Option 6: Exit the application.
3. Follow the input prompts to customize your search or visualization.
4. View results directly in the console or as a graphical word cloud.

Libraries Used:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- `wikipedia`: For interacting with Wikipedia's API to fetch summaries, 
  categories, links, and content.
- `googlesearch-python`: For performing Google searches and retrieving links.
- `wordcloud`: For generating visual word clouds from text content.
- `matplotlib`: For displaying the word cloud in a graphical window.

Customization and Extension:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This app is designed with scalability in mind. Developers can easily:
- Add more features, such as advanced Wikipedia search options, Google search
  result filtering, or integration with other APIs.
- Enhance the user interface by migrating to a GUI framework like `tkinter` or 
  `PyQt`.
- Save outputs to files, such as exporting summaries, links, or word clouds to 
  text or image formats.
- Integrate NLP libraries (like `spaCy` or `NLTK`) for advanced text analysis 
  on Wikipedia content.

Potential Use Cases:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Academic Research:
  Quickly retrieve summaries, categories, and related topics for study.
- Data Exploration:
  Use word clouds and related topics to uncover trends or associations.
- General Knowledge:
  Explore topics and dive into detailed information interactively.
- Content Creation:
  Generate ideas, summaries, or research links for articles, blogs, or videos.

Conclusion:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Python Super App is a versatile tool for knowledge discovery, visualization,
and exploration. Whether you're a developer, researcher, or curious learner, 
this app brings the power of Wikipedia and Google to your fingertips with just a
few lines of code. Built on a strong foundation of modularity and user-centric 
design, it is an excellent starting point for building more complex applications 
in Python.

Enjoy exploring the world of information!
